The first official meeting for the Houston Haskell Users Group was a success!
There seems to be many Haskellers in the Houston area who are hungry to learn
more.

<!--more-->

We talked about installing GHC and Cabal, working with Cabal sandboxes,
resolving dependencies and errors that arise from Cabal use from time to
time, and much more.

The slides and code samples can be found here: [GHCandCabal.slides](/talks/GHCandCabal/index.html)

If you are in the Houston area or just passing through and would like to give a talk
or just join us the email me: christopher at reichert brothers dot com.

Happy Hacking!
