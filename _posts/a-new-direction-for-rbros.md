I give a lot of thought to my work habits. My primary goal is to be as
productive as possible in the shortest time frames possible. Although it's a
constant struggle, the closer I get to my _ideal_ productivity any given day,
the **more time** I have to enjoy as I please.


To start, I want to outline a few of the responsibilities that I have. The
nature of my tasks from day to day can change drastically.

# Principles:

I've found these principles have significantly increased my effectiveness

- Avoid distraction at all costs

- Be realistic about limitations< prioritize most important tasks

- Factor in admin tasks

- Break down tasks & Clump orthogonal tasks

- Don't overburden

# Tools

- Task inbox (todo list)

    I am not a fan of TODO lists in general. My "TODO" list is actually more like a task inbox

- Mail

-

# Process

- Refer to TODO list (browser extension). An item is either actionable or not actionable. Not actionable items either need to be rescheduled,
